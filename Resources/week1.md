## Setup :wrench:

In this course we'll use Python venv as virtualenvironment instead of pip. This is to both learn another virtualenvironment tool that is common and also pipenv that we've used before has some problems with locking certain versions of packages and some dependency problems. 

1. Create a new repository on Github for this course and clone your repository to your local machine

2. Install venv using pip to your machine.

3. Create the virtual environment with python 3.9

```bash
python3.9 -m venv <your_venv_name>
```

4. Now activate your venv: 

For windows use this command: 

```bash
<your_venv_name>\Scripts\activate 
```

For mac or linux

```bash
source <your_venv_name>/bin/activate
```
